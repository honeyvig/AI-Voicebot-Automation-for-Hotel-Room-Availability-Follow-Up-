---------
To build the AI Voicebot for automating hotel room availability inquiries and follow-up processes, we will break down the system into different components that address each of the project requirements. This will involve:

    Voicebot functionality to make outbound calls.
    Integration with India-based phone numbers for making and receiving calls.
    NLP capabilities for understanding hotel staff responses.
    API Integration with your existing system for availability and booking details.
    Post-check-in/check-out follow-ups.

Here's a Python-based approach for creating the AI Voicebot with the specified features:
Project Breakdown:

    Voicebot Architecture:
        We'll use Twilio, Exotel, or similar APIs for India-based phone number integration.
        The Voicebot will use Google Cloud Speech-to-Text or Amazon Transcribe for converting speech to text and Google Dialogflow or Rasa for natural language understanding (NLP).
        The backend will be powered by Flask or FastAPI to manage API calls and integrations.

    Twilio Setup:
        Twilio offers phone number support in India, allowing us to make automated calls using a virtual number. We'll use Twilio for integration with India phone numbers.

    NLP:
        Google Dialogflow can be used for NLP to recognize hotel staff responses and understand availability-related queries.
        For multi-language support (e.g., Hindi, English), Dialogflow provides language support, which is ideal for handling conversational AI in regional languages.

    Data Integration:
        APIs to manage room availability, booking data, and customer interaction status updates.

Step-by-Step Implementation:
1. Twilio Integration for Making Outbound Calls:

Install Twilio SDK:

pip install twilio

Set up the Twilio account by creating an account at Twilio, and get your Account SID, Auth Token, and a Twilio phone number for India.

Sample Python code for making an outbound call with Twilio:

from twilio.rest import Client

# Twilio credentials from the account
account_sid = 'your_account_sid'
auth_token = 'your_auth_token'
twilio_number = 'your_twilio_number'

client = Client(account_sid, auth_token)

def make_outbound_call(to_number, message_url):
    call = client.calls.create(
        to=to_number,
        from_=twilio_number,
        url=message_url  # This URL will point to the Twilio server-side code
    )
    print(f"Initiated call with SID: {call.sid}")

# Example: Make a call to an Indian hotel number
hotel_number = '+911234567890'  # Example hotel number
message_url = 'http://example.com/your_twiml_response.xml'  # URL to your Twilio response
make_outbound_call(hotel_number, message_url)

Note: The URL (message_url) should point to a server-side endpoint that responds with a Twilio Markup Language (TwiML) script to guide the conversation.
2. Speech Recognition with Google Cloud or Amazon Transcribe:

You can use Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API for converting speech to text from the hotel staff. First, install the necessary libraries:

pip install google-cloud-speech

Then, use it to transcribe speech:

from google.cloud import speech
import io

def transcribe_audio(audio_file_path):
    client = speech.SpeechClient()

    with io.open(audio_file_path, 'rb') as audio_file:
        content = audio_file.read()

    audio = speech.RecognitionAudio(content=content)
    config = speech.RecognitionConfig(
        encoding=speech.RecognitionConfig.AudioEncoding.LINEAR16,
        sample_rate_hertz=16000,
        language_code="en-IN",  # You can set this to Hindi or any regional language
    )

    response = client.recognize(config=config, audio=audio)

    # Process the response and return the transcribed text
    for result in response.results:
        print(f"Transcript: {result.alternatives[0].transcript}")
        return result.alternatives[0].transcript

3. Dialogflow for NLP Integration:

You can use Google Dialogflow to understand the responses and handle the conversational flow. Create an agent on the Dialogflow Console and train it to handle room availability and other queries.

Install the Dialogflow SDK:

pip install dialogflow

Here’s an example of querying Dialogflow:

import dialogflow_v2 as dialogflow
from google.api_core.exceptions import InvalidArgument

def detect_intent_texts(project_id, session_id, text, language_code='en'):
    session_client = dialogflow.SessionsClient()
    session = session_client.session_path(project_id, session_id)

    text_input = dialogflow.types.TextInput(text=text, language_code=language_code)
    query_input = dialogflow.types.QueryInput(text=text_input)

    try:
        response = session_client.detect_intent(session=session, query_input=query_input)
        return response.query_result.fulfillment_text
    except InvalidArgument:
        raise Exception("Dialogflow Error")

# Example usage with an input text
project_id = 'your-dialogflow-project-id'
session_id = 'your-session-id'
response = detect_intent_texts(project_id, session_id, "Is the room available for tonight?")
print(response)

4. Automating Follow-Up Calls Post Check-In/Out:

For the post-check-in and post-check-out follow-ups, you can create specific outbound calls to ask about the customer’s experience or resolve pending issues. The logic can be very similar to the outbound calls for availability.

Example:

def follow_up_call(to_number):
    follow_up_message_url = 'http://example.com/follow_up_twiml_response.xml'  # URL to follow-up TwiML response
    make_outbound_call(to_number, follow_up_message_url)

5. Integrating Room Availability & Bookings with Your System:

The system should interact with your existing backend to get real-time room availability, bookings, and customer details. This could be achieved through REST APIs or database queries.

Example of a simple API request to check availability:

import requests

def check_room_availability(date, hotel_id):
    url = "https://your-backend-system.com/api/room_availability"
    params = {
        "hotel_id": hotel_id,
        "date": date
    }
    response = requests.get(url, params=params)
    return response.json()  # Assume this returns availability info

You can then integrate this function into your Dialogflow or Twilio responses to check room availability in real-time.
Project Timeline Estimate:

    Voicebot Setup: 2-3 days (integrating Twilio for outbound calls, setting up the backend server).
    Speech-to-Text and NLP Integration: 3-4 days (integration of Google Speech-to-Text or Amazon Transcribe and Dialogflow for NLP).
    Follow-Up Functionality: 2 days (automating post-check-in and check-out follow-ups).
    API Integration for Real-Time Availability: 3-4 days (integration with your existing backend for data handling).
    Testing and Debugging: 2-3 days (testing across different scenarios and languages).

Total Estimated Time: Around 10-15 days.
Conclusion:

This AI-powered voicebot will automate hotel room inquiries, integrate with your backend for availability, and handle follow-up calls, enhancing the guest experience while optimizing hotel operations. The integration of Twilio, NLP (Dialogflow), and speech recognition (Google Cloud or Amazon Transcribe) will ensure that the bot can interact seamlessly with hotel staff and guests, handling a variety of queries in multiple languages.
